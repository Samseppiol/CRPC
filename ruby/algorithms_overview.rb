#Create an array
a = [1, 4, 6, 9 ,2 ,3 ,22, 44, 66, 1]
#Sort out array. Wouldn't really need our own sorting algorithm when ruby can already do it.
#.sort is actually a 'quick sort' algorithm built in to ruby. Amazing we can do such a complex
#task with one line of code!
p a.sort
#Because learning how to write a sorting algorithm is base knowledge for computer science.
