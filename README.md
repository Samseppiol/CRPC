CRPC
Comprehensive Ruby Programming Course by Jordan Hudgens on Udemy.

So I changed the some details of the readme file on the
git web interface. Holy shit did that cause some horrifying problems. I have just spent the last hour attempting to get git push and pull working again. Merged out to a branch, committed the branch then checked out master and merged the branch. Everything now seems to be working. Thankfully I did not put my fist through the monitor.
